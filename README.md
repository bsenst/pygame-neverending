# pygame-neverending
Contribution to the [PyGame Week 32](https://pyweek.org/32/).

This is an experimental game that allows the player to move across randomly created maps. When the border of the map is crossed another map will be entered. The journey will countinue and never ends.

It is a minimal viable program and contribution to the PyWeek 32 challenge. The code was delivered by the author of this repository, bsenst. The artwork is limited to ASCII characters.

The game depends on the following libraries:
* pygame 2.0.1 (SDL 2.0.14, Python 3.9.1)
* numpy 1.20.2
* random

The code released under the MIT license.
